# Runtime Errors Fixed - October 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ useToast Hook Context Error
**Problem:** `useToast must be used within a ToastProvider`
- The `useUnhandledPromiseRejection` hook was being called in `AppWithErrorHandling` before the `ToastProvider` was initialized

**Solution:** 
- Moved the `ErrorHandlerInitializer` component inside the provider hierarchy
- Changed from: `ToastProvider > ErrorHandlerInitializer > AuthProvider`
- Changed to: `ToastProvider > AuthProvider > ErrorHandlerInitializer`

### 2. ❌ Multiple React Root Warning
**Problem:** `ReactDOMClient.createRoot() called on container that has already been passed to createRoot()`
- Hot module reload was causing multiple root creation attempts

**Solution:**
- Added check to prevent multiple root creation
- Store root reference on DOM element to reuse existing root

### 3. ❌ Auth Queue Timeouts
**Problem:** `Task timed out after 10000ms (queue has 1 running, 1 waiting)`
- Auth operations were timing out due to aggressive timeout settings

**Solution:**
- Increased auth queue timeout from 10s to 30s
- Increased state queue timeout from 5s to 15s

### 4. ❌ Google Calendar Backend Errors
**Problem:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'u', "function js"... is not valid JSON`
- Backend API endpoints not available in development mode

**Solution:**
- Modified GoogleCalendarContext to skip backend proxy checks in development
- Added `import.meta.env.DEV` check to bypass backend requirements locally

### 5. ✅ Database Service Encryption
**Status:** Temporarily simplified encryption methods
- Removed complex async encryption to prevent compatibility issues
- TODO: Re-implement full encryption with proper async/await handling

## Files Modified

1. **index.tsx**
   - Fixed provider hierarchy
   - Added multiple root prevention
   
2. **services/authQueueService.ts**
   - Increased timeout values
   
3. **context/GoogleCalendarContext.tsx**
   - Added development mode bypass for backend checks
   
4. **services/databaseService.ts**
   - Simplified encryption methods (user modified)

## Current Status

✅ **Application Now Running Successfully**
- No more React context errors
- No more timeout issues in auth operations
- No more JSON parse errors from backend
- App loads and renders correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Re-implement encryption system** with proper async/await handling
2. **Set up backend proxy** for production deployment
3. **Add proper error monitoring** integration
4. **Test all authentication flows** thoroughly

## Development Notes

- Application running on http://localhost:5177/
- All critical errors resolved
- Core functionality restored
- Ready for feature development and testing
